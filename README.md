# Playing with Great Circles

## Specification
```
We'd like to contact partners with offices within 100km of central London (coordinates 51.515419, -0.141099) to invite them out for a meal.

Write a NodeJS/JavaScript program that reads a list of partners in json and outputs the company names and addresses of matching partners (with offices within 100km) sorted by company name (ascending).
